# How to Run repo 

1. Make sure you are in a virtual enviornment. Run the following code in your terminal.
    - `source venv/bin/activate` 

2. You may need to add variables to PATH. Put this in your terminal.
    - ` export FLASK_ENV=development` 

3. Now you're ready to run the flask server.

    - ` flask run`


At this point your terminal is running a flask server. You should be able to see the site at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
