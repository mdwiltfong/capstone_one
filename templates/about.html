        <p>Teacher Pay was made by me, Michael Wiltfong. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, practically every
            school in Canada had ceased in-person classefa-spin
            and switched to online learning. Suddenly everyone was usuing Zoom, and the world began heavily relying on
            technology and the internet to interact with each other. Teacher Pay is a solution
            for private tutors to interact with their students and easily deal with invoicing and quotes when it comes
            to offering their services.

        <p>
            Using Stripe's API, Teacher Pay is able to generate detailed quotes that help tutors portray their most
            professional self to their clients. Once a quote is accepted and paid for, the tutor no longer has
            to worry about monthly (or weekly) biling since it will be handled by Teacher pay. Teacher Pay is also a
            safe and secure platform for handling transactions. All credit card, and bank information is actually sent
            directly to Stripe. This way, teachers and parents don't have to worry about where their information is
            being sent to. This also includes the actual processing of payments.
